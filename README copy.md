# UCACCMET2J Python assignment
This file contains some information about the dataset you will be working with for this assignment. The data itself is included with this repository. Please make sure that you have first forked the repository to your own GitHub account before cloning it to your computer and starting to work on it.

## Does it always rain in Seattle?

### The data
You are provided with two datasets: one set contains weather stations associated with their locations, in the form of a CSV file. This file is called `stations.csv` and contains 4 entries. The other set contains rain in tenths of millimeters per day per weather station in 2010. This file is called `precipitation.json` and contains approximately 1450 entries. Take a look at the two files and their structure.

### The big data
Load the JSON data and loop through it. We want you to calculate the monthly mm of rain for Seattle, as well as the total mm of rain over the whole year.

### Relatively rainy
Next, we want you to calculate the percentage of the yearly rain per month; i.e., if 20% of the rain in 2010 in Seattle fell in November, the corresponding value should read 0.2.

### Results
Save these results in a single JSON file called `result.json`. Save your data in a dictionary, where location name is the key, and the value is another dictionary, containing the corresponding state, weather station, precipitation per month, relative precipitation per month, total precipitation.

An partial example of correct output (with values left out) for Cincinnati would be:

```python
{
	"Cincinnati": {
		"station": "GHCND:USW00093814", 
		"state": "OH", 
		"totalMonthlyPrecipitation": [...], 
		"relativeMonthlyPrecipitation": [...], 
		"totalYearlyPrecipitation": ...,
		"relativeYearlyPrecipitation": ...
	},
	...
}
```
